// =============================================================================
// Extension host provisioning — place an extension's bytes ON the host that owns
// the workspace (local OR remote) and return its host-absolute root dir. This is
// the single, branch-free install path: everything downstream (static serving,
// server spawn) reads/runs from a runtime-host dir via runtime.file.* /
// runtime.server.*, with no isLocal special-case.
//
//   catalog : client stages the verified .tgz (download.ts), then — through the
//             runtime daemon — uploads it and extracts host-side into
//             ~/.cate/extensions/<id>/<version>. Idempotent via the host .ok
//             marker, so the bytes are uploaded at most once per host+version.
//   sideload: LOCAL shares the client fs (served in place); a remote host can't
//             see the dev folder, so the folder is uploaded to the host.
//
// Local is NOT a shortcut here — the LOCAL daemon is just another host reached
// over the runtime, so the same writeBinary/extract path runs for it too.
