// =============================================================================
// Workspace canvas access — resolves a workspace's primary ("center") canvas
// panel, its canvas store, and its CanvasOperations bridge.
//
// Canvas stores are keyed by PANEL id (getOrCreateCanvasStoreForPanel in
// canvasStore.ts), not by workspace id, because a workspace can host several
// canvas panels (nested canvases) and a canvas panel belongs to exactly one
// workspace. This module owns the canvas-panel-id -> CanvasOperations registry
// and the discovery of a workspace's primary canvas panel.
//
// It imports from appStore (to read workspace/panel state) and canvasStore (for
// the panel-keyed store factory). That one-directional appStore dependency is
// fine: the appStore <-> session cycle is broken separately via
// lib/workspace/deferredRestore.ts.

//
// Invalidation rule (correctness MUST match the uncached dock-layout walk):
//   - When a workspace first caches an entry, we subscribe to its live dock
//     store and clear that workspace's entry on ANY dock-layout change. Dock
//     changes are the only thing that can move which canvas panel is "primary"
//     (the walk prefers the center zone, then other zones, then any panel), so
//     this re-walks lazily after every dock mutation — identical to no cache.
//   - Cleared for a workspace when that workspace is removed (appStore's
//     removeWorkspace cleanup calls invalidateWorkspaceCanvasCache).
//   - Cleared globally when any canvas panel is unregistered
//     (unregisterCanvasOps) — a belt-and-suspenders guard for canvas panels
//     that never had a live dock store subscription.
// As an extra safety net, a read only serves the cached id if it is still a
// canvas panel of the workspace (verified against appStore state).
